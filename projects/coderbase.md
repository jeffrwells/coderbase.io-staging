# Summary

*Note: This project is very much a work in progress. You are looking at it right now.*

Coderbase.io is a portfolio platform for developers. It seeks to create the ideal online identity for developers. It combines blog-style posts, projects that contain annotations -- such as what you are reading right now -- and basic pages.

One of the most interesting parts about it is that everything is driven through Markdown, YAML, and Git. There is no admin UI through the browser. When a user signs up through GitHub, a new repository is created on his/her GitHub account that contains all of the configurations and content.

See below for further details and pictures.


# Motivation

Hiring extremely talented software engineers is a significant challenge for tech companies today. More than any other factor, the people at a company make or break its success. For this reason, managers and recruiters go to great lengths to determine a job candidate's abilities and qualifications before making a decision. Time and effort are wasted for the employer as well as the engineer.

To attack this problem my team and I wanted to create a platform that allowed developers to show their proficiency in programming, their personality, and their ability to solve problems as well as gain exposure through writing.

We hope to replace a resume, blog, and GitHub profile with one single portfolio accessible by a custom domain name: (eg jeffrwells.com). The portfolio is well designed and minimally featured to make it easier to use and more attractive than any other service or custom-built solution.

# How it works

Coderbase.io is built for developers, and is designed to work in tune with a developer's typical workflow. We recognized early on that

When a user signs up through his/her GitHub account, a new repository called *coderbase.io* is created that hosts all of the portfolio's posts, projects, and configurations in markdown and YAML files.

These files can now be edited any way that our users want. For quick changes, using the GitHub editor is often easiest. Users can also pull down the repository to edit it in their text editor or a special markdown program. Here you can see me writing these words (so meta) in Atom:
