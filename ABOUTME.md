**If you want to get a feel for my work and code, see the [Coderbase project](http://jeffrwells.com/projects/coderbase). It is the portfolio platform that this was built on, and contains tons of code samples and details on the motivation for and implementation of the project.**

I learned to code less than two years ago but have come a long way. I learned by building a SaaS product that assists with recruitment in college fraternities and sororities. Within 6 months, I sold this software to a number of fraternity chapters around the country but have since shut it down.

I also founded a 501(c)3 nonprofit called [Arizona Microcredit Initiative](http://azmicrocredit.org) (AMI) my sophomore year of college. See these articles in the [Arizona Republic](http://www.azcentral.com/business/abg/articles/20140129students-fuel-businesses.html) and [State Press](http://www.statepress.com/2014/02/12/honors-students-nonprofit-program-arizona-microcredit-initiative-reaches-new-success/).

As a founder and executive director, I have learned an inexplicable amount on leadership and social dynamics. In AMI, I have gone through the roles of founder, executive director, team member, board of directors, and advisor. As executive director, I managed a team of 16 individuals. During that year, we raised $70,000, established numerous community partnerships, and created a new group class and curriculum that was a huge success and has made a great impact for our clients. I've had challenges of leading a team of contrarian individuals, building a sustainable organization that will survive beyond my leadership, and building effective workflows and accountability for a part time volunteer organization.

I have interned at [Recruiting.com](http://recruiting.com) and [New Relic](http://newrelic.com) as a software engineer, and am currently building this platform: Coderbase.io. [Read more about Coderbase](http://jeffrwells.com/projects/coderbase).

During my 12 weeks as an intern at New Relic, I became lead developer and project manager for our top priority milestone. The project was adding security features for SAML single sign on for our enterprise customers. This feature was a priority because it was a requirement for a major deal (largest ARR deal at the time) with a new enterprise customer. I planned and implemented the project on time, and it was deployed (after my departure) with no problems. I worked in Ruby on Rails at New Relic.

At Recruiting.com I worked in JavaScript and Backbone.js to build a recruitment platform for sourcing and managing candidates. I created a mechanism inspired by Rails Turbolinks to load in new pages. The pages used an ASP backend to start JavaScript applications, and were very slow to load as a result. My new feature brought load time from ~4 seconds (really bad!) to ~1 second (not as bad, and usable).

I am graduating with a Computer Science degree in the Spring of 2014. I'm from Portland, Oregon.
